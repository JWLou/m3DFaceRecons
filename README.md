# m3DFaceRecons
The MATLAB implementation of a monocular 3D face reconstruction algorithm.

This implementation is based on the following paper:
- Thies, J., Zollhofer, M., Stamminger, M., Theobalt, C., & Nießner, M. (2016). Face2face: Real-time face capture and reenactment of rgb videos. Proc. IEEE CVPR, 2387–2395

# Setup
- Create a folder - 'model' under 'm3DFaceRecons', put the 3DMM models into it.
- Put the 'EPnP' folder extracted from the following link into 'm3DFaceRecons/util/'.

# Dependency
- EPnP: https://www.epfl.ch/labs/cvlab/software/multi-view-stereo/epnp/.
- 3DMM models: please send emails to jianwen.lou.ly@gmail.com for the models.
